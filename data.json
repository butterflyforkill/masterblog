        "content": "Dr. Bannakit is a forensic pathologist working at a provincial hospital. One day, he was performing an autopsy on a woman who had died by hanging and concluded that it was a murder, not a suicide. From that moment on, he himself became the target of an influential person. Shortly after his imprisonment, an unknown man breaks into his house and threatens him, demanding that he change his autopsy report. Dr. Ban does not take this man's threat seriously until one of his friends, a prosecutor, disappears. He begins to conduct a secret investigation to get to the bottom of the truth, and somehow all the evidence leads to Ten becoming the main suspect. Ten, however, denies everything and instead convinces Dr. Ban to work together to solve the case and find the real killer.\r\n"
